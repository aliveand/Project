# PROJECT RapidShot

### DESCRIPTION

The project consists in developing and designing a browser game called Rapidshot. This is a 2D game, where you will have a crosshair on the cursor to kill the enemies that will appear, aiming and doing click.

The game will have a score during the play time, to accumulate the dead enemies or points earned and at the end of the level you will see your score.

The game will have several different levels, which go in progression of difficulty

The only tool that you will need to kill your enemies, will be your skill with the pointer.
